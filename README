This is an alpha release of Beta Vulgaris aka Beet ChucK framework and live
electronics software.

It has been successfully tested on Fedora 13-14 GNU/Linux with default alsa
audio driver during two live performances.

DEPENDENCIES:
  pyportmidi
  pyliblo


To use it do one of two:
  1. edit Loader.ck file in Utils folder with paths to sound files you want to
     use and start run.sh script. The software is prepared to work with MIDI
     controller only, so it's not said to be very useful with no additional
     editing
  2. use it as a framework to build your own software
